```# Vault Logs Analysis – Bug Bounty Report ✅

## Project Overview
We analyzed the Balancer Vault smart contract to identify unusual activity in vault logs. Our focus was on the last 100 blocks to detect abnormal patterns in Total Logs and Swap Logs.

- **Smart Contract:** [Balancer Vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8)  
- **ABI Used:** Standard Vault ABI for decoding events.  
- **Data Source:** JSON export of vault logs (provided in Gist).  
- **Chart Visualization:** QuickChart used to plot trends of Total Logs vs Swap Logs.

## Key Observations
- Most blocks contained 0–2 logs.  
- Some blocks showed unusually high log counts, indicating potential abnormal activity.  
- Swap logs in this dataset were consistently zero.

## Suspicious Blocks

| Block Number | Total Logs | Remark |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| 23196246     | 10         | Significantly higher than neighboring blocks; multiple transactions |
| 23196266     | 3          | Multiple logs from the same transaction |
| 23196271     | 2          | Contains different topic0 hashes |
| 23196244     | 2          | Logs with differing topic0 values |
| 23196256     | 1          | Single log but unusual topic0 |

## Notes
- The data is reproducible using the JSON file in the Gist.  
- Highlighted blocks may require further investigation.  
- Suggested next step: deeper analysis of transactions in blocks 23196246 and 23196266 to check for anomalous patterns.
